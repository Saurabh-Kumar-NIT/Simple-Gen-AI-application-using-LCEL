# Simple-Gen-AI-application-using-LCEL
A simple Generative AI application using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) that enables text-based AI interactions. It leverages LCEL for prompt engineering, FastAPI for serving responses, and Uvicorn for deployment. Ideal for learning AI workflows and experimenting with GenAI models. üöÄ


Generative AI Application using LCEL
A simple Generative AI application leveraging LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to build AI-driven text generation workflows. The project integrates GEMMA as the foundational model, constructs a prompt template, and deploys a FastAPI-based service.

Project Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Use GEMMA Model
Load the GEMMA model for text generation.
Ensure the model is optimized for efficiency and accuracy.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Prompt Template
Design structured prompts using LCEL.
Enable dynamic variable injection for better response control.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Chain Creation with LCEL
Build a LangChain pipeline to process input and generate outputs.
Use LCEL for modular prompt handling and chaining.

4Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI Integration
Develop a FastAPI-based REST API to serve the generative model.
Implement an endpoint for receiving user inputs and generating responses.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Execution & Deployment
Run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.
Deploy on local or cloud-based environments for easy access
